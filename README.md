# LearningProjects

This repository is a collection of various learning projects I'm working on to improve my skills in different areas such as programming, electronics, and problem-solving. It includes solutions to coding challenges, small electronics projects, and anything else that sparks my curiosity. The goal is to experiment, learn, and document my progress along the way.

## Leetcode Challenges

This folder contains my Leetcode solutions, primarily in **C**, and **Python** when needed (e.g., for complex data structures). Problems are organized by topic (e.g., Arrays, Strings, DP).

## HF Projects

The HF-Projects folder contains experiments and projects related to **high-frequency (HF) electronics**, with a focus on **microstrip transmission line technology**. Projects include, but are not limited to:  

- Designing, simulating, and testing microstrip-based components and filters  
- Experiments aimed at understanding HF behavior and practical applications  
- A computation tool for general HF calculations, which will be continuously expanded  
- Other HF-related experiments and projects under development

## MCU Basics

The MCU-Basics folder contains experiments and projects related to **microcontrollers**, focusing on **hands-on electronics and embedded programming**. Projects are designed to cover the fundamentals.

The goal is to **explore, experiment, and document** all the core MCU concepts using **ESP32** and **Arduino**, building a solid foundation in embedded systems.
