# HF Microstrip Design Calculator

A handy little tool to help with designing microstrip circuits for RF stuff.  

## What it can do
- Calculate **characteristic impedance (Z0)** for a microstrip line
- Figure out the **width of a microstrip line** for a given Z0
- Convert **wavelength ↔ frequency**
- Help design **Wilkinson power dividers** and calculate the resistor values

## How to use it
- Enter your substrate height, dielectric constant, or the impedance/frequency you want
- Get the line width, wavelength, or divider values in return
- Perfect for experimenting with HF / RF microstrip designs

## Notes
- Right now it only does microstrip stuff
- Planning to add more RF components in future updates
